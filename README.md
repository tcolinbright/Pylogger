# Pylogger

This is a set of logging programs created using Python's logging module and Tkinter GUI toolkit.
Each program allows users to enter troubleshooting steps or other information into a text field, which is then written to a log file with a timestamp. The logs can be searched and viewed within the program, and are stored in a directory named "logs". These programs can be easily run on local machines or inside a Docker container.
